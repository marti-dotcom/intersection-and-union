# Intersection & Union of BED4 Intervals

A clean, dependency-free Python CLI for computing the **union** or **intersection** of two BED4 files.
Designed for clarity, explicit edge-case handling, and easy reuse in bioinformatics pipelines.

- **Input:** two whitespace-separated BED4 files with columns: `chrom  start  end  name`
- **Output:** a BED4 file you specify
- **Operations:** `union` (merge by feature name within a chromosome), `isec` (pairwise interval overlap per chromosome)
- **Python:** 3.8+

> Note: BED is typically **0-based, half-open**; chromosome labels must match exactly (e.g., `chr1` vs `1` are different).

---

## Motivation

**Goal:** Read two BED4 files and, based on user choice, compute **either** the union **or** the intersection.

**Intersection (isec)**  
Report **all non-empty overlaps** between each interval in file 1 and each interval in file 2 **on the same chromosome**.

- Overlap rule (half-open intervals): `[a,b)` and `[c,d)` overlap iff `a < d` **and** `c < b`.
- Example: `[30,50)` & `[50,70)` → **no overlap**
- Example: `[30,52)` & `[50,70)` → **overlap** `[50,52)`
- The feature **name** in the output is taken from **file 1**.

**Union (union)**  
Output **all features** that occur in at least one file.

- If a feature name occurs **in only one** file → include as-is.  
- If a feature name occurs in **both** files on **different chromosomes** → **exclude both**.  
- If a feature name occurs in **both** files on the **same chromosome** → output a **single** interval using the **smallest covering span** of both:
  - `[30,40)` + `[70,90)` → `[30,90)`
  - `[30,50)` + `[40,45)` → `[30,50)`

**CLI contract (argparse)**

- `operation` (`union` or `isec`)
- `input1` path
- `input2` path
- `output` path

The order of output lines is not important for the script.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Union (merge by feature name if on the same chromosome)
python mycode.py union main.bed.txt unionsecondfile.bed.txt union_results.bed.txt
cat union_results.bed.txt

# Intersection (interval overlap by chromosome; name is taken from file1)
python mycode.py isec  main.bed.txt intersectionsecondfile.bed.txt isec_results.bed.txt
cat isec_results.bed.txt

# CLI help
python mycode.py -h
```

## Features included

**Robust parsing**
- Skips blank lines and `#` comments
- Accepts whitespace-separated columns (tabs or spaces)
- Auto-swaps inverted intervals (`start > end`)
- Defaults `name` to `.` if the 4th column is missing

**Union**
- Groups intervals **by name** across both files
- Merges only when intervals with the same name are on the **same chromosome**
- Flags & drops “same name but different chromosome”

**Intersection**
- Checks **pairwise overlaps** by chromosome (no requirement to match names)
- Output `name` is inherited from the **file1** interval

**Clear output & errors**
- Summary stats printed to stdout
- Warnings/parse errors printed to stderr (with line numbers)

---

## Usage

```bash
python mycode.py {union|isec} <input1.bed> <input2.bed> <output.bed>

```
-**union**: merge intervals by feature name if on the same chromosome.
start = min(start_a, start_b); end = max(end_a, end_b)
Pairs with identical names on different chromosomes are excluded.

-**isec**: report overlapping regions by chromosome for all pairs between file1 and file2.
Overlap calculation:

```
overlap_start = max(start_a, start_b)
overlap_end   = min(end_a, end_b)
emit if overlap_start < overlap_end
```
Output name is taken from file1’s interval.

---
**How it works**
```read_bed_file(path)```

Validates file existence, parses into (chrom, start, end, name), skips malformed rows and non-integers, prints warnings with line numbers.

```find_unions(intervals1, intervals2)```

Concatenates both lists; groups by name. Ensures all intervals for a given name share the same chromosome; otherwise marks the group as invalid. Emits one merged interval per valid name.

**Examples (files included)**

python mycode.py union main.bed.txt unionsecondfile.bed.txt union_results.bed.txt
python mycode.py isec  main.bed.txt intersectionsecondfile.bed.txt isec_results.bed.txt

The repository includes the following example inputs/outputs at the repo root:

- ```main.bed.txt```

- ```unionsecondfile.bed.txt```

- ```intersectionsecondfile.bed.txt```

- ```union_results.bed.txt``` (generated by the command below)

- ```isec_results.bed.txt``` (generated by the command below)

Run the following please:

**Union example**
```python mycode.py union main.bed.txt unionsecondfile.bed.txt union_results.bed.txt
cat union_results.bed.txt
```

**Intersection example**
```python mycode.py isec main.bed.txt intersectionsecondfile.bed.txt isec_results.bed.txt
cat isec_results.bed.txt
```

**Appendix: BED4 Files**

A **BED4** file has four columns (whitespace separated):

1. chrom – chromosome/contig label (e.g., chr1)

2. start – 0-based start (inclusive)

3. end – 0-based end (exclusive)

4. name – feature label (optional; defaults to . in this tool)

Lines beginning with # are treated as comments and ignored.
